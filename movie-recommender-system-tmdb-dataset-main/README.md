# movie-recommender-system-tmdb-dataset

A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity
Here we have used TMDB's Data Base to train our model & we also use API provied by TMDB to load movie info. on search for the website we are using streamlit library its is a an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for Data Science and ML in short time

Currently my project is hosted on heroku so website might take some time to load but it does work also on loading it opens the about page so just scroll up and you will see the interface for the website :)
